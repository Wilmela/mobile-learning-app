          Upholstery is the work of providing furniture, especially seats, with
          padding, springs, webbing, and fabric or leather covers. The word also
          refers to the materials used to upholster something.
          {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          Furniture-making process of furniture manufacturing involves
          designing, cutting, shaping, joining, finishing, and assembling
          various materials such as wood, metal, plastic, and glass to create a
          final product that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
        </SubHeadingText>
        <Content>
          There are various types of upholstery and furniture, each with its own

          A furniture making material refers to any substance or material used
          in the construction and fabrication of furniture pieces. These
          materials are chosen based on their suitability for specific furniture
          designs, desired aesthetics, durability, cost, and functionality. Here
          are some common furniture making materials: A furniture making

          and fabrication of furniture pieces. These materials are chosen based
          on their suitability for specific furniture designs, desired
          aesthetics, durability, cost, and functionality. Here are some common
          furniture making materials: {"\n"}
        </SubHeadingText>
        <Content>
          1. Plastics: are a wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials
          that use polymers as a main ingredient. Their plasticity makes it
          possible for plastics to be moulded, extruded or pressed into solid
          objects of various shapes. Plastic is very suitable for the outdoors
          and comes in a variety of colors. However, Plastic material furniture
          loses it's strength over time. {"\n"}
          2. Metal is a material that, when freshly prepared, polished, or
          fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and
          heat relatively well. Metals are typically ductile and malleable.
          These properties are the result of the metallic bond between the atoms
          or molecules of the metal. For structures where wood is not strong
          enough, metal is a common choice due to its natural strength and
          resistance. It is more expensive than wood. {"\n"}
          3. Glass is a non-crystalline, often transparent, amorphous solid that
          has widespread practical, technological, and decorative use in, for
          example, window panes, tableware, and optics. Glass is most often
          formed by rapid cooling of the molten form; some glasses such as
          volcanic glass are naturally occurring. Glass is a unique raw material
          used by manufacturers to create furniture. Glass tables are popularly
          used for dining and decorative purposes. {"\n"}
          4. Leather is a strong, flexible and durable material obtained from
          the tanning, or chemical treatment, of animal skins and hides to
          prevent decay. The most common leathers come from cattle, sheep,
          goats, equine animals, buffalo, pigs and hogs, and aquatic animals
          such as seals and alligators. Leather: Leather is extensively used to
          make sofas. They reflect luxury, comfort and durability. Leather sofas
          are suitable for rough use. {"\n"}
          5. Lumber is wood that has been processed into uniform and useful
          sizes, including beams and planks or boards. Lumber is mainly used for
          construction framing, as well as finishing. Lumber has many uses
          beyond home building. Lumber is the most authentic material used to
          make furniture. {"\n"}
          6. Stainless steel is an alloy of iron that is resistant to rusting
          and corrosion. It contains at least 11% chromium and may contain
          elements such as carbon, other nonmetals and to obtain other desired
          properties.

          Wood is an organic substance derived from the live tree and has a
          fibrous, heterogeneous, and anisotropic texture. One of the ancient
          building materials is wood. The main physical properties of wood
          include color, luster, texture, macro-structure, odor, moisture,
          shrinkage, internal stresses, swelling, cracking, warping, density,
          sound – electro – thermal conductivity. Сolor, shine, texture, and
          macrostructure determine the appearance of wood.
        </SubHeadingText>

        <Content>
          1. Sensory Characteristics: Color, luster, smell, flavor, texture,
          grain, figure, weight, and hardness of wood are examples of sensory
          properties. For purposes of identification or other uses, these
          additional macroscopic features are useful in describing a piece of
          wood. {"\n"}
          2. Density and specific gravity: Specific gravity is the ratio of the
          weight or mass of wood to that of water, while density is the weight
          or mass of a unit volume of wood. Because 1 cc of water weighs 1 gram,
          the average density and specific gravity of Douglas fir wood are both
          0.45 gram per cubic centimeter (g/cc), respectively. {"\n"}
          3. Hygroscopicity: If in touch with water, wood can absorb it as a
          liquid or as a vapor from the air. Water is the most significant
          liquid or gas that wood can absorb, despite this. Wood always includes
          moisture due to its hygroscopic nature, whether it is a component of
          the living tree or a material.{"\n"}
          4. Shrinkage and swelling: When the moisture level in wood varies
          below the fiber saturation point, dimensional changes occur. Shrinkage
          and swelling are caused by moisture gain and loss, respectively. These
          dimensional changes are anisotropic, meaning they differ in the axial,
          radial, and tangential directions. {"\n"}
          5. Degradation: Bacteria, fungi, insects, marine borers, as well as
          environmental, mechanical, chemical, and thermal variables, all
          contribute to the destruction of wood. The look, structure, or
          chemical makeup of wood can change due to degradation, which can
          impact living trees, logs, or products. {"\n"}
          6. Thermal properties: Even though wood expands and contracts with
          variations in temperature, shrinkage, and swelling brought on by
          changes in moisture content are much more significant dimensional
          alterations.{"\n"}
          7. Electric properties: Electrical insulation can be found in
          oven-dried wood. However, when moisture content rises, electric
          conductivity rises as well, causing saturated wood (wood with the
          highest moisture content) to behave more like water.

            1. Mortise and tenon joint connects two pieces of wood or other
            material. Woodworkers around the world have used it for thousands of
            years to join pieces of wood, mainly when the adjoining pieces
            connect at right angles.

            2. Miter” is another word for an angled cut—and the saw that makes
            the cut. In the term “miter joint,” it refers to two 45-degree
            angled cuts where the pieces of wood adjoin to create a 90-degree
            angle.

            3. butt joint is the most basic type of wood joint. Two different
            wood pieces simply sit side by side, with the butt of one workpiece
            adjacent to the butt of another workpiece.

          <ContentImg url={w3} />
          <Content>
            4. These joints consist of a tongue, or a ridge, on one piece of
            wood and a groove, or channel, on the other. The tongue slides into
            the groove to create a strong joint.

          Framed structures are the structures which are formed by connecting a
          series of horizontal and vertical structural members in suitable
          positions. The framed structures primarily comprise of columns and
          beams. Columns are connected by beams at the floor and roof levels.
          The floors are divided into rooms and passages of required sizes by
          walls. The walls may be load-bearing walls or partition walls. The
          materials used for framed structures, in general, maybe wood or steel.
        </SubHeadingText>

        <Content>
          Materials Used for Framed Structures includes:{"\n"}
          1. Timber: Use of timber for framed structures offer several
          advantages like beauty, versatility, durability, low cost, high
          strength-to-weight ratio, excellent electrical insulation and high
          shock absorption capacity.{"\n"}
          2. Steel: In general, the steel framework supports all loads. In this
          type, all columns, beams and girders in the framed structure are of
          the steel section. Adequate bracing is needed for these structures in
          order to resist the wind and earthquake forces. {"\n"}
          3. Reinforced cement concrete (RCC): forms the best material for

          4. Wood Lathe: The process of working of wood on a lathe is termed as
          “Wood Turning”. The wood lathe is much like the regular lathe used for
          turning metal and it enables us to shape any wooden workpiece. {"\n"}
          5. Bandsaw: The history of this woodworking machine can be traced as
          far as to the early nineteenth century. This band fits over two or
          more rotating wheels which are driven by powerful electric motors.

          6. Router: This handheld power tool provides us the capability to be
          hollow out sections in any wood workpiece and any other materials. The
          router to some extent looks a lot like the handheld sander since it
          also has a circular blade like a sander.

          A roof (PL: roofs or rooves) is the top covering of a building,
          including all materials and constructions necessary to support it on
          the walls of the building or on uprights, providing protection against
          rain, snow, sunlight, extremes of temperature, and wind.[1] A roof is
          part of the building envelope. The characteristics of a roof are
          dependent upon the purpose of the building that it covers, the
          available roofing materials and the local traditions of construction
          and wider concepts of architectural design and practice, and may also
          be governed by local or national legislation. In most countries, a
          roof protects primarily against rain.

          There are various types of roof but only few shell be discussed today.
          They are;
        </SubHeadingText>

        <Content>
          1. Flat roof is a roof that is completely, or almost level. However,
          whilst they are described as ‘flat’ almost all flat roofs are actually
          laid to a fall to ensure that rainwater can run off to the lower side.
          Typically they are designed to have a minimum fall of 1:40, which
          given on-site inaccuracies should result in a minimum fall of at least
          1:80 in the finished construction. {"\n"} 2. Mansard roof, also known
          as a French or curb roof, is a roof characterized by that fact that
          each of its four sides has two pitches, the lower pitches being
          steeper than the upper pitches. It is similar to a gambrel roof but
          differs in that it displays the same profile on all sides (whereas a
          gambrel roof has vertical gables at either end).{"\n"}
          3. Gambrel roof (also known simply as a gambrel), is a type of
          two-sided roof that is characterised by vertical gable ends and two
          slopes on each side. The upper slope is of a shallower pitch than the
          lower slope which is steeper. {"\n"}
          4. Shell roofs are made from structural ‘skins’ where the shell
          material is thin in section relative to the other dimensions of the
          roof and undergoes relatively little deformation under load.{"\n"}
          5. Metal roof covering in several different ways. The main forms are
          based on sheet-like panels, which may be flat or profiled, and either
          prefabricated, or formed on site, but metal can also be used to create
          shingles - formed into shapes similar to tiles, shakes or slates.
          Sheet metal roofing is typically joined by standing seams or rolled
          joints.
